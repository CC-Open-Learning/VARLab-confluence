                    <p>To be fair, the ideal situation for VARLab is when our DLX do not know anything about our end users and where we let the LMS manage user access and authentication all by itself with no help from us!  The vast majority of our DLX work this way, but there are a few isolated examples of learning experiences that do ask users to input information that could be construed as personally identifiable.  At the time of writing this page, it is my understanding that all of our DLX, including those few outliers, are in compliance with the <a class="external-link" href="https://www-assets.conestogac.on.ca/documents/www/about/policies/information-governance/protection-of-privacy-policy.pdf" rel="nofollow">Protection of Privacy Policy</a> at Conestoga College.</p><hr/><p>Copied from the<a class="external-link" href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/what-is-personal-information.pdf" rel="nofollow"> Ontario Privacy Commission Fact Sheet “What is Personal Information?”</a> dated October 2016:</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p><strong>Definition of “personal information” in the acts</strong> “personal information” means recorded information about an identifiable individual, including, </p><p>(a) information relating to the race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation or marital or family status of the individual, </p><p>(b) information relating to the education or the medical, psychiatric, psychological, criminal or employment history of the individual or information relating to financial transactions in which the individual has been involved, </p><p>(c) any identifying number, symbol or other particular assigned to the individual, </p><p>(d) the address, telephone number, fingerprints or blood type of the individual, </p><p>(e) the personal opinions or views of the individual except where they relate to another individual, </p><p>(f) correspondence sent to an institution by the individual that is implicitly or explicitly of a private or confidential nature, and replies to that correspondence that would reveal the contents of the original correspondence, </p><p>(g) the views or opinions of another individual about the individual, and </p><p>(h) the individual’s name where it appears with other personal information relating to the individual or where the disclosure of the name would reveal other personal information about the individual</p></div></div><p /><h3 id="ProtectingUserPrivacyinDLX-ExamplesofVARLabDLXthatdonotrequestoracceptuserinputofpersonalinformation:">Examples of VARLab DLX that do not request or accept user input of personal information:</h3><ul><li><p>Bloom (all modules)</p></li><li><p>Motive Power 1.0 and 1.1</p></li><li><p>Trucking Pre-Trip Inspection</p></li><li><p>Heavy Equipment (all modules)</p></li><li><p>Precision Machining (all modules)</p></li><li><p>Firefighting: HazMat</p></li></ul><p /><h3 id="ProtectingUserPrivacyinDLX-ExamplesofVARLabDLXthatdorequestandacceptuserinputofpersonalinformation,inaccordancewithcollegeprivacypolicy:">Examples of VARLab DLX that do request and accept user input of personal information, in accordance with college privacy policy:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Firefighting: SAR 1.0 and 2.0</strong> - The user is invited to enter their name and e-mail address, but this is not required to play the simulation.
