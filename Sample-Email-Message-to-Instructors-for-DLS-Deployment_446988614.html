The generic instructions are currently under development (document is out for review) but will likely be made available as a webpage that instructors can refer to anytime they need a refresher.  This email template is not planned to be used moving forward.</p></div></div><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Copy and paste this sample text into the body of your email message to the course instructors who will be using the DLS in their program.  Update the text with details for your DLS.</p></div></div><p>As discussed, I have created a model course shell for the <span class="legacy-color-text-red2">[Title of DLS]</span> learning simulation modules.  All you need to do is import this content into your own course shell in eConestoga, then enrol your students and they will be good to go. </p><p>You probably already know how to do this, but just in case you need a quick refresher, here are some simple steps to import this content to your course:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>From your course, open the Course Admin panel and select Import/Export/Copy Components. This is located in the Site Resources section of the Course Admin panel.</p></li><li><p>Under &quot;Copy Components from another Org Unit&quot;, click the Search for Offering button.</p></li><li><p>Search for â€œVARLAB&quot;.  From the search results, select Offering Code <span class="legacy-color-text-red2">&quot;[copy your Offering Code here]</span>&quot; The Offering Name will include VARLAB and <span class="legacy-color-text-red2">[Title of your DLS]</span>. Click the box beside that course and click Add Selected.</p></li><li><p>Click &quot;Copy All Components&quot;. This will take a few minutes, there is a progress bar to let you know how it's going.</p></li></ol><p>Once you've got the contents into your own course shell, you can add or edit descriptions, dates, or instructions for your students as you see fit.  </p><p>PLEASE NOTE: These modules are currently set with NO grade value, so it's important not to mess with that. The digital learning modules will not report any grades to eConestoga, so if you set them as gradable, all students will get zero!</p><p>Please let me know if you have any problems. We look forward to a smooth and engaging learning experience for your students!</p><p />
