</div><h2 id="Stepbystep,gettingreadyforUAT-IsmyprojectreadyforUAT?">Is my project ready for UAT?</h2><p>UAT is, ideally, the last stage of development. It is conducted when there is no more work to be done on a project. If the UAT comes back positive, the build you have right now should be ready to be deployed as soon as the results are back.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t work on it anymore, but you should only have to do adjustments based on the participants' feedback to the main experience. As we all know, bugfixing is something that happens even after a project goes live, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should send your project to UAT with known bugs in it since your participants might give you feedback on things that you are already aware of and that is going to be a waste of your and their time.</p><p /><h2 id="Stepbystep,gettingreadyforUAT-MyprojectisreadyforUAT,whathappensnow?">My project is ready for UAT, what happens now?</h2><p>You have ironed all the bugs, all the features are in and you have fully tested the simulation on the intended platform (i.e. you&rsquo;ve deployed it as a SCORM object on eConestoga). Now is when you freeze production and get a build that won&rsquo;t be worked on during UAT, especially if your simulation shares any content with other projects. You need to know what version your participants will be testing in case, for example, a known bug is reported, it is important to know if it has been fixed since this built was created or if it is something that has come up again and should be addressed once more.</p><p>The first thing you should do is think about creating Intro/Outro segments for your simulation, or if you already have some, make sure that they prepare the UAT participant for the test. The context for the UAT and the live version of the simulation won&rsquo;t be the same, so you might have to give them that context somehow. </p><h3 id="Stepbystep,gettingreadyforUAT-CreatinganintromoduleinVTS">Creating an intro module in VTS</h3><p>To create an intro module, we need a script, a background image and to choose an avatar and a voice for the avatar.

It is already integrated with the Microsoft 365 package we all have access to, it is designed for gathering feedback and you can download the results in Excel format instead of a .csv that you would need to convert, like other tools do.</p><p>We currently have a template for feedback forms that you can find in the <a href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAR/pages/275317072/Documenting+the+UAT" data-linked-resource-id="275317072" data-linked-resource-version="10" data-linked-resource-type="page">Documenting the UAT</a> page. It is meant to showcase what you can do with Microsoft Forms, feel free to put your own twist to it, add/remove questions or frame them differently if you feel there is a better approach. Your simulation probably has content specific questions that we of course did not plan for, so it is expected that you would do some editing to this template. Just make sure you are working on a copy instead of the template itself.</p><p>We would be happy to hear any feedback you have on the template so we can continue improving on it.</p><p /><h2 id="Stepbystep,gettingreadyforUAT-Gatheringparticipants">Gathering participants</h2><p>A crucial part of the UAT is getting the right participants for the test. You will need to get in contact with the content expert and ask them to gather a group of 10-15 people that are familiar with the course and have an active eConestoga account. We will get better feedback from people that either have real-life experience with the simulated topic, have trained for it, or both. At the same time, if we get the Nobel Prize for Physics to test our simulation, but they can&rsquo;t access eConestoga, that top-tier feedback will take a lot more work and will probably delay the UAT process (I&rsquo;m sure we would make an exception for a Nobel Prize though) so anyone without an @conestogac.on.ca e-mail address will be promptly discarded from the participants list.</p><p>You might not get ten people, or you might get more than ten people from the content expert. As long as it is not only the content expert testing, it should be fine. A minimum number of participants would be five, but don&rsquo;t tell that to the content expert (unless they tell you they couldn&rsquo;t get enough people to test). </p><p>Here is a suggested list of information that content experts will want to know when they are signing up volunteers from their program (you may choose to copy and paste some or all of this info into your email with the content experts):</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" data-local-id="0d9f6164-6073-4305-849d-cd490052e67c" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 680.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>We are ready for you to gather some volunteers from your program to participate in User Acceptance Testing!&nbsp; The goal of this activity is to ensure that students are able to access and complete the learning simulation without any difficulties, and to validate that the content is clear and understandable. Ideally, we would like to have at least 10-15 volunteers so that we can be sure to get an adequate mix of students and instructors in the final responses.</p><p><span data-colorid="bkuca4gmeu">What do the volunteers need to do?</span></p><p>We send an email to all of the volunteers that contains a direct link to the digital learning simulation on eConestoga.&nbsp; All volunteers must have a valid Conestoga email account, and access to eConestoga.&nbsp; All they need to do is click the link, play through the learning simulation (which will include a short introductory video to show them how to use the controls) and then answer a survey at the end.</p><p><span data-colorid="fx8r7des41">How long will this take?</span></p><p>The exact time commitment will vary, depending on how much time the volunteers spend in the simulation.&nbsp; We expect the entire experience, including the survey, to take between 45-90 minutes.</p><p><span data-colorid="taxl7u49oz">Does it have to be done at a specific time?</span></p><p>Volunteers can complete their review and survey at any time that is convenient for them.&nbsp; We will provide a deadline when the survey needs to be completed.

They can use any laptop, Chromebook, or home computer with internet access, but they cannot use a phone or tablet (no touch-screen devices). No specialized equipment is required. There is nothing to download or install. Even the survey is online.</p><p><span data-colorid="h7clxul6sp">Is help available for volunteers who experience difficulties?</span></p><p>Absolutely - volunteers will be provided with the direct email address of a VARLab team member who can help them if they get stuck or have any trouble accessing the digital learning experience or the survey.</p><p>Please just let me know if I can provide any further information.&nbsp; We would ideally like to conduct this testing during [provide dates or target timeline], and we welcome all student &amp; instructor feedback about this simulation!</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p /><h2 id="Stepbystep,gettingreadyforUAT-DeployingtheUAT">Deploying the UAT</h2><p>You have everything you need to conduct the UAT, so now it is time to make all of that available to your UAT participants. We have two dedicated UAT course shells, so that we can run two separate UAT&rsquo;s at the same time.</p><p>Here you should upload the project&rsquo;s intro, main simulation and outro, should your project have all those pieces. If there is any particular documentation that your participants should have for the test, make sure to upload it here as well. Remember to present these in the order they should be accessed, to make the participant&rsquo;s job as foolproof as we can. Ensure that your participants will have easy access to the UAT Feedback Survey that you have created (you can add it as a link in the eConestoga course shell, just below the final module of your DLS).</p><p>Once everything is ready, contact your participants by email to get them started.  Most of our volunteers have never participated in this type of activity, so they have lots of questions. You can improve response rate and make volunteers more comfortable by addressing common concerns in your initial email.

You can check the responses as they come in, but it is probably better to have everyone&rsquo;s responses before doing this, for efficiency reasons.</p><p>You can watch the responses on the Microsoft Forms' page or you can download them as an excel file. Downloading them means you get the chance to add comments to particular answers, as well as have something that&rsquo;s easy to share with the rest of the team.</p><p>With the information retrieved from the surveys, now it is time to write a report that reflects the state of the simulation. The most important thing is if there is any &ldquo;gamebreaking&ldquo; or high impact issue that would stop the simulation from being deployed. After that, is there any low cost improvement that could be done before deploying? Make sure these are covered in your report, and you could add potential solutions that could be tried to address the issues. You should also share any interesting point that came up in the responses, even if it is not a bug, like a feature the users particularly like and maybe we should think of trying in other simulations too.</p><p>If there is anything that should be addressed before going live, now is the moment to go back into development. If everything worked smoothly, then your project is ready to be released, congratulations!!</p><p>More detail into what is considered to fit each of these categories can be found in <a href="UAT-Feedback-Management_404586501.html" data-linked-resource-id="404586501" data-linked-resource-version="5" data-linked-resource-type="page">this article</a>.</p><p /><h2 id="Stepbystep,gettingreadyforUAT-Finalthoughts">Final thoughts</h2><p>Remember that as a UAT designer/developer you are representing the VARLab in front of the content experts and UAT participants. Always be cordial and professional, make sure you are receptive to external feedback and don&rsquo;t take more time than necessary from them. This will probably be the first exposure to the VARLab for them and we want to make the best impression possible on them!! If for any reason you find yourself in a difficult position when dealing with content experts or UAT participants, please contact someone from the VLT and ask for support.</p><p /><p />
