With our team growing in capability and number, it is natural that design and development efforts can drift into their own capability areas rather than be leveraged in a mutually supportive way to enhance and focus DLX product outcomes. If you are unfamiliar with a term in this playbook, see the glossary at the bottom of the page.</p><p>Moving forward, we should reinforce every DLX product's mission to deliver learner value. This means that while we favor pedagogical outcomes over technological outcomes in general, we accept that we are also commissioned to design, build, and ship products on time for our customers - Conestoga&rsquo;s faculty and students.</p><h2 id="DLXProductPlaybook-DiscoveryandDelivery-ThenewD&amp;D">Discovery and Delivery - The new D&amp;D</h2><p>The table below summarizes an adaptation of the <a class="external-link" href="https://productcoalition.com/the-typeform-product-playbook-49e1a5cc3a08" rel="nofollow">Typeform Product Playbook</a> which blends product management and agile development practices. Please consider this chart a consistent work in progress that will govern the alignment of our efforts to discover and deliver DLX titles. This model is applied to our work on a <em><strong>Buy-In/Chime-In</strong></em> basis, which means that we anticipate everyone in the organization will buy in and support this framework unless there is an opportunity to chime in or contribute suggestions that are constructive to enhancing this playbook.</p><p /><h1 style="text-align: center;" id="DLXProductPlaybook-DLXProductPlaybook">DLX Product

This playbook aims to support agile thinking throughout the discovery and delivery phases of a DLX product development. We&rsquo;ll use processes that are working, refine those that are not working, and then add in parts that might be missing as needed.</p><h3 id="DLXProductPlaybook-Q:HowdoIfitin?">Q: How do I fit in?</h3><p>A: Great question! No matter if one develops digital art, instructional design and materials, code, technical support, product management or endless Crazy Russ Projects (tm) there should be something your role identifies with here. Beyond that, we encourage and benefit as a team when everyone thinks in a more trans-disciplinary way. This means that when we can see a bigger picture view of the whole work, we gain more opportunities to collaborate and support each other instead of operating inside of a &lsquo;silo' minded approach to completing your work.</p><h2 id="DLXProductPlaybook-NextSteps">Next Steps</h2><p>Please familiarize yourself with the different activities and outcomes of the DLX Product Playbook by following the links in the table and the page navigation here in Confluence. Talk to your colleagues about how you can support each other to buy-in/chime-in and help evolve our DLX production processes.</p><p /><p><strong><span data-colorid="fn2y6buewb">GLOSSARY</span></strong></p><p><strong>A/B Testing: &ldquo;</strong>A/B testing is a valuable tool in Agile development for validating items in the backlog<strong>.</strong> By systematically comparing two versions (A and B) of a feature, teams can gather empirical data on user preferences and performance&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria: &ldquo;</strong>Acceptance criteria are tools used when working with requirements. They comprise a set of conditions that new functionality must meet to be accepted by clients, end users, or other stakeholders&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Backlog Refinement: &ldquo;</strong>Backlog refinement is the process of reviewing, ranking, and editing your <a class="external-link" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/backlogs" rel="nofollow"><u>product backlog</u></a>. Backlog refinement is an important tool in your product development process because it helps your development team build only the features and functionalities that the customer wants and the business needs. Backlog refinement is an ongoing process championed by the product owner, product managers, scrum master, and representatives from the development team.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Buy/Build/Partner: </strong>Refers to the VLT decision on how to move forward with the project. Buy - a solution already on the market. Build - Create the solution entirely in-house. Partner: Work with an external vendor to create the solution.</p><p><strong>Concierge: &ldquo;</strong>Concierge MVP is an approach that entrepreneurs use to test the concept of the product. This method allows the product owner to connect with the users and learn how they respond to the product. It is a manual technique where a startup would manually perform the tasks of their eventual products or service would automate. It is simply testing the idea of the product without actually building it.&nbsp; Just like hotel concierge services, you offer personalized services that imitate the <a class="external-link" href="https://codup.co/blog/functional-prototypes/" rel="nofollow">functions of a fully developed application</a>. By manually performing every function, you can validate whether or not your product can have a strong standing in the market.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Customer Interviews: </strong><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="4d062cd8-0fee-4a3b-b4e5-bb15b4b8a12e">Customer interviews</span> can be used at the earliest stage (even before requirements gathering) to get a sense of the background and context, your observations, the problem and opportunities for solutions. They can also be used throughout the project at various stages to collect feedback on the DLX, certain design aspects or features or just to know  your students and faculty better. </p><p><strong>Dashboard: &ldquo;</strong>Agile teams rely on dashboards to <strong>manage tasks and track work efficiently.</strong> The metrics included within team dashboards enable stakeholders to receive intuitive, at-a-glance, and detailed information to keep project leaders in the loop when managing project and team performance with added precision.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Data Analysis: </strong>What stories do we want to tell with our metrics? How do we cultivate trust and hold ourselves accountable? What follow-up questions does the data invite? </p><ul><li><p><strong>&ldquo;Decisions over dashboards</strong>: By focusing on what people want to <em>do</em> with data, we can move past the first set of questions they ask, focus on the valuable iteration and follow-up questions, build trust, cultivate curiosity and drive action.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functional analysis over perfect outputs:</strong> To enable quick iterations, we&rsquo;re going to have to spend less time crafting perfect outputs and focus on moving from one question to the next as quickly as possible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sharing data over gatekeeping data:</strong> We&rsquo;re going to have to share responsibility for our data and data &ldquo;products&rdquo; with our business partners. This will help build trust, and keep us all accountable for cultivating great data products and data-driven cultures.&rdquo;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Definition of Ready: </strong>In our context, this would be a checklist that all design criteria have been met and accepted, and the project is ready to move into the next phase of delivery and begin development.</p><p><strong>Earliest Testable Product: &ldquo;</strong> Earliest Testable Product&nbsp;is the first release that customers can actually do something with. Might not solve their problem, but it generates at least some kind of feedback. We make it very clear that learning is the main purpose of this release, and that any actual customer value will be a bonus.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Earliest Usable Product: &ldquo;</strong>Earliest Usable Product is the first release that early adopters will actually use, willingly. It is far from done, and it might not be very likeable&hellip; But it does put your customers in a better position than before.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Earliest Loveable Product: </strong>&ldquo;Earliest Lovable Product&nbsp;is the  first release that customers will love, tell their friends about, and be willing to pay for. There&rsquo;s still lots to improve, and we may still end up with a convertible, or a plane, or something else. But we&rsquo;ve reached the point where we have a truly marketable product.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Event Storming: </strong>Event storming is a collaborative workshop technique used in software development to understand the context of what the DLX needs in its program area. It involves dev and design teams working together with the content experts to map out key events, processes, and decisions that are crucial for to meet the learning outcomes of the DLX. Imagine it as a brainstorming session with sticky notes on a whiteboard, but focused on events that drive the DLX functionality. This shared understanding helps create a DLX experience that aligns with real-world business needs.</p><p><strong>Internal Reviews: </strong></p><p>In software development, an internal review refers to the process where a peer or colleague examines work done by another developer <strong>before</strong> it's integrated into the main codebase. It's essentially a quality check conducted internally within the development team.</p><p>The goal of an internal review is to identify and address potential issues early on. This can include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bugs and errors:</strong> Catching mistakes in logic, syntax, or functionality before they cause problems later.</p></li><li><p><strong>Code quality:</strong> Ensuring code adheres to coding standards, best practices, and maintainability principles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design considerations:</strong> Evaluating if the code solution aligns with the overall software design and architecture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Checking if comments and documentation are clear and informative for future reference.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Lean UX Canvas: &ldquo;</strong>Lean UX is a tool that helps your team dissect and solve your business problems by hypothesis and experimentation. Unlike traditional UX, lean UX focuses more on the experience and less on the quantity of deliverables. Your team must therefore collect feedback as early in the design process as possible. So, lean UX demands closer team collaboration than traditional methods. The lean UX canvas empowers you to work in rapid, iterative cycles without giving up quality.&nbsp; Lean UX canvas is beneficial during project research, design, and planning&mdash;especially the discovery phase. When your team is developing a variety of projects at the same time, traditional UX methods often won&rsquo;t work. You simply cannot use standard methods to deliver UX in such a short time. Luckily, lean UX helps you deliver a high-quality user experience without sacrificing efficiency.&nbsp;&ldquo;</p><p><strong>MoSCOW</strong>: &ldquo;Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won&rsquo;t Have (or will not have now)&rdquo; - a way of prioritizing design decisions and articulating scope.</p><p><strong>Product Management Council: </strong>A biweekly meeting held by the VLT to review and update on projects and to collectively make decisions that require input of several members of the team.</p><p><strong>Project Charter: </strong>&ldquo;A project charter is a formal document delineating the project's purpose, scope, stakeholders, objectives, and comprehensive plan. This document should guide all subsequent decisions and actions.&rdquo; <em><span data-colorid="ltbufous0m">(Edit - Add link to Project Charter Template)</span></em></p><p><strong>Release Plan: &ldquo;</strong>An Agile release plan maps out how and when features (or functionality) will be released and delivered to users.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Selection Matrix: </strong>An internal document that helps to guide and review proposed DLX projects based on impact, need and resource/capacity viability. <em><span data-colorid="hex7eu2e1q">(Edit - Add link to Selection Matrix template here)</span></em></p><p><strong>Game Design Document/ Solution Document: </strong>A game design document (GDD) and a solutions document serve different purposes in the game development process:</p><p>Game Design Document (GDD)<strong>:</strong>The GDD focuses on the &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot; of the game. It outlines the core gameplay mechanics, story, characters, world, art style, and overall vision for the <a class="external-link" href="http://game.It" rel="nofollow">game.</a> It&rsquo;s primarily for internal communication within the development team, but it can also be used for external purposes like pitching the story. It&rsquo;s used to establish the foundation of the game.</p><p>Solution Document: The solutions document focuses on the &quot;how&quot; of the game. It details specific technical solutions and approaches to implement the features and mechanics outlined in the GDD. This might include level design specifics, code implementation plans, etc. It&rsquo;s meant primarily for programmers, artists, and other developers who will be responsible for building the game. The solutions document is typically created later in development, after the core concepts of the game are established in the GDD.</p><p>Think of the GDD as a blueprint for a house. It specifies the number of rooms, their purpose, and the overall style. The solutions document would be like the engineer's notes on how to build the foundation, frame the house, and implement the plumbing and electrical systems. In short, the GDD describes the dream, and the solutions document details how to make that dream a reality. <em><span data-colorid="g0x8qwixjk">(Edit - Add link to Game Design document template here)</span></em></p><p><strong>Spikes: </strong>(Also known as Proof of Concept or POC) &ldquo;A Spike is created when a user story or task cannot be estimated well enough until the team has done further research or investigation. The result of a spike is an estimate for the original user story so that the sprint can move forward.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Story backlog: </strong>In Agile development, a story backlog, also known as a product backlog, is a prioritized list of all the work items needed to develop a software product. These work items typically include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>User stories:</strong> These are small descriptions of features or functionalities written from the perspective of the end-user. They focus on what the user wants to achieve.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bugs:</strong> Issues or defects that need to be fixed in the product.</p></li><li><p><strong><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="7bfd9ba0-d146-45c2-a05e-6fd23adf52bd">Technical Debt:</span></strong> Design choices or code implementations that might cause problems later but provide a short-term benefit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other work items:</strong> This could include tasks like performance improvements, documentation updates, or infrastructure changes.</p></li></ul><p>The backlog is constantly evolving as new information is learned, priorities change, and the product vision takes shape. The product owner, who represents the stakeholders' interests, is responsible for prioritizing the items in the backlog. The development team then pulls in high-priority items from the backlog during each sprint (a short development cycle) and commits to delivering them within that timeframe.</p><p><strong>Story Mapping: &ldquo;</strong>Story Mapping or User Story Mapping is a technique used in product discovery: outlining a new product or a new feature for an existing product. The result is a Story Map: all the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nimblework.com/agile/user-stories/" rel="nofollow">user stories</a> arranged in functional groups. This helps you keep your eye on the big picture while also providing all the details of the whole application.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Vision Document: </strong> To be completed prior to the Project Charter, the vision document tells the story of what the vision for the DLX is going to be. It includes the overview of the problem being solved, descriptions of the learners and where they are at in their learning journies, reviewing what exists in the market already and how this DLX meets a need that isn&rsquo;t met elsewhere, identifies the stakeholders, communication and support strategies and what the long-term success goals and supports will be at one, two and three-year post-release markers.  <em><span data-colorid="ydg0cvs8o3">(Edit - Add link to Vision Document here)</span></em></p><p><strong>Walkthrough:</strong></p><p>In Agile development, &quot;walkthrough&quot; can have two meanings depending on the context:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Informal Demo:</strong> It can refer to a quick and informal demonstration of a feature or functionality that's under development. This is often done during daily standup meetings or sprint reviews to keep stakeholders updated on progress and gather early feedback.</p></li><li><p><strong>User Story Breakdown:</strong> It can also describe the process of collaboratively breaking down a user story (a small description of a feature) into specific tasks during sprint planning. This walkthrough ensures everyone on the development team understands the user story's requirements and how they'll be tackled within the sprint timeframe.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Wizard of Oz:&rdquo;</strong>A user-research method where a user interacts with a mock interface controlled, to some degree, by a person. Helps teams test designs powered by complex technologies at low cost&rdquo;.</p><p /><p />
