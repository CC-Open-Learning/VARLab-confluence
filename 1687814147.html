                    <p>This document will give an overview on how we might be able to recover assets from external vendor projects, the time required to do so, and when this would be most appropriate. </p><h2 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-WhatFilesDoWeExpectToHave?">What Files Do We Expect To Have?</h2><p>In the super-best case scenario we have also been provided any source files for making 3D models and for surfacing. This does not seem like a likely outcome in most cases, so let’s instead look at the most realistic best-case scenario. </p><p>In the best case scenario they have given us:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>All the assets as (preferably) FBX files</p></li><li><p>Texture files including:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Colour</p></li><li><p>Normal</p></li><li><p>Metal</p></li><li><p>Roughness</p></li><li><p>Ambient Occlusion. </p></li></ol></li></ol><p>Do note that we might receive these files in slightly different manners. For example, depending on the external vendor’s workflow, we might have a Smoothness map instead of a Roughness map. The good news is that these maps are inversions of each other - if we have one it is little effort to invert the image and get the other. Also note that it is technically possible to generate most of these maps to some extend if we have the Colour map and nothing else though a tool such as <a class="external-link" href="https://www.boundingboxsoftware.com/materialize/" rel="nofollow">Materialize</a>, though mileage on the end result might vary.  </p><p>While the files above would get us everything we need in order to generate all the files we actually use, but is not a comprehensive list of the <a href="3D-Asset-Core-Deliverables-At-a-Glance_775618689.html" data-linked-resource-id="775618689" data-linked-resource-version="10" data-linked-resource-type="page">core deliverables we expect to have when we have made something in-house. </a></p><h2 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-SoWhatIfAllWeHaveisaBuild?">So What If All We Have is a Build?</h2><p>Ideally we have the source files. At very least we would want the Unity project files, but having a build might mean that assets are still salvageable. The process changes depending on what type of build we have. For example, we are actually able to decompile a Windows executable and turn it back into a Unity project. If we have a WebGL build, it might also be possible to extract assets from that (though I have not yet looked into how, exactly, to do this)</p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-SoWeHaveAUnityBuild">So We Have A Unity Build</h3><p>We can use a tool such as Asset Ripper, which is available from a public GitHub repo <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This tool needs to be pointed at the Unity built Windows executable file. From here it can crawl the files and allows us to look at some aspects. The interface here is not ideal though, and navigation is slow and clunky. But the good news is that this very same software was designed to restore a Unity project from a Unity build. </p><p>After this point, it becomes a matter of deconstructing the project file structure and finding the things we need. Luckily, we can use the familiar Unity UI in order to do this once we have a project, which makes searching for assets easier, and allows us to quickly find files even if we don’t know what they're called by exploring the links and relationships present in the Inspector window. </p><p>From here we should be able to use Unity’s FBX Exporter to send the model files out of Unity. I did have a hard time finding the FBX Exporter tool in Unity 2019, so I brought the version forward to Unity 6. This didn’t seem to have any adverse side effects on the models (though likely breaks many interactions and dependencies), so this should be fine for this use-case. I would advise against jumping versions if possible. </p><p>There’s still some more work to do after this, but more on that in a later section.</p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-SoWeHaveaWebGLBuild">So We Have a WebGL Build</h3><p>Fantastic. I haven’t looked into this extensively, but <a class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Zxgb8SLKM" rel="nofollow">here is a video</a> claiming it can be done!</p><h2 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-We’veRetrievedSomeFiles.WhatNow?">We’ve Retrieved Some Files. What Now?</h2><p>Congratulations! Hopefully at this point you have an FBX file and a small collection of images. What happens next will really depend on a lot of factors. There are a lot of questions to ask, and this is by no means a comprehensive list of those questions.</p><p><em>Has the object been atlassed with other objects? If so, was this done in such a way that makes sense to always import all of these assets together?</em></p><p><em>What texture files did you end up with? Do you at least have the files listed above? Did we luck out and end up with all of the files outlined in </em><a href="3D-Asset-Core-Deliverables-At-a-Glance_775618689.html" data-linked-resource-id="775618689" data-linked-resource-version="10" data-linked-resource-type="page"><em>Asset Deliverables At a Glance</em></a><em>?</em></p><p><em>Does the size of the textures make sense given their importance?</em></p><p><em>Will we use these assets as-is, or do they need any revisions, such as typos on any embedded text?</em></p><p>Practically, this last question is less important as we can technically work these files even if the answer to this question isn’t yes, but it can be frustrating for all people involved if the answer is no: <em>Does the asset have names that make sense, even if they don’t correspond directly to our own expected naming conventions?</em></p><p>Depending on the answers to the above questions (and more, on a case-by case), the next steps will change. </p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-EverythingisInOrder!">Everything is In Order!</h3><p>It might be that the assets are usable as-is. This means we’ve got out FBX, and all the expected texture files. This would mean, likely, that we need to generate the MRO file that our proprietary shaders expects to use. Its probably possible to batch this process through Photoshop and some diligent file structuring. All in all, this process should not be too intensive.</p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-TheObjectisAtlassedForPerformance,ButTheAtlassedSetsDon’tCoverFlexibility">The Object is Atlassed For Performance, But The Atlassed Sets Don’t Cover Flexibility</h3><p>This likely becomes one of the more involved processes. This largely depends on the resolution of the source image and the arrangement of the UV islands. </p><p>If the atlas is neat and square, then we’re on a good path! In this case it might be possible to rearrange the object’s UVs and do some photo manipulation to keep the same UV layout, but remove it from the atlas</p><p>However, if the atlas is not neat, and UVs are kinda scattered all around, simple rearrangement likely isn't possible. The next steps truly depend on a case by case. The worse case scenario would mean Re UV-unwrapping the objects, and manually retexturing. The good thing about this approach is that we would simply be generating the maps we expect, so the state of the textures does not matter. </p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-We’veGottheColourMap!….andNotMuchElse!">We’ve Got the Colour Map! …. and Not Much Else!</h3><p>This is a real possibility. There’s no requirement to work with <em>any</em> texture maps at all. But if we have the Colour map, then we can use a tool like I mentioned above to regenerate the rest of the maps. However, Materialize doesn’t export MRO maps, so these would need to be manually assembled (or batched together!). It might also be though, that we need to retexture things entirely. </p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-TheMapsareHUGE!">The Maps are HUGE!</h3><p>Somewhat notoriously, the external vendors seem to have a penchant to using 4k textures in inappropriate places. This can bloat our build sizes. And this <em>is</em> correctable in engine but setting up the materials to have a maximum resolution at build time. However, using these big files might be tempting fate. Likely we would reduce these images to a more appropriate resolution and put them in the Import folder, and keep the massive files as Originals in the Source files. This is relatively easy and also very batchable. </p><p>There is, of course, always the option of retexturing</p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-There&#39;sSomeIssueswithSurfaceDetail,LikeTypos.CanWeFixThis?">There's Some Issues with Surface Detail, Like Typos. Can We Fix This?</h3><p>Yes, of course. Depending on the maps involved, this might be possible just using Photoshop. But also… it might mean retexturing!</p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-AboutThoseNamingConventions…">About Those Naming Conventions…</h3><p>As mentioned above, this is much less important, but it can be very frustrating working with a bunch of assets with mesh names like “<em>pb_Mesh_122871”. </em>I can’t read that. I don’t know what that is. This will cause difficulties during model revisions if needed, because we may need to start guessing at parts, especially in cases where the models are quite complicated. Some time could be put into renaming these, though this is really only advisable if revisions to the model are needed. </p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-Hey,So.TheWholeSceneSeemstoComeoutWhenIExporttheFBX?">Hey, So. The Whole Scene Seems to Come out When I Export the FBX?</h3><p>This is a possibility. In this case It would likely mean manually separating the object back out into individual parts. How long this takes depends on how many distinct models there are. This could cause some UV layout issues, and might mean redoing the UVs, which would then mean redoing the textures. The worse case scenario here would essentially be that we have models and are resurfacing everything, but at least we have the models!</p><h2 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-SoIsThisEvenAdvisable?">So Is This Even Advisable?</h2><p>Yes and No, it really depends. The amount of work would really depend on all the factors above, and more. We have some other questions to ask, like are we likely to need this at all in the future anyways? Things like the furniture from CSi, all pieces of a retro diner might not be all that likely to be useful to us again. Things like the assets in SAR might be more desirable, if w are planning to do an in-house rebuild of the project. </p><p>Probably we should play through the sims and try to identify high-value assets. After that we can try to pull them out. Depending on the asset, however, It might be faster and easier to simply use a screenshot of the asset as reference and rebuild the project.</p><p>It is almost certainly not worthwhile to do this for a single asset in a project, unless that model is of very high complexity. We don't want to go and rip a salt shaker, but something like a full firetruck might me a good candidate.  Each identified asset would have to be appraised on how long it would take to hand make before we go to any of the other trouble, and we also will not know what issues we might encounter with recovery until we start.</p><h2 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-AnyOtherRealConcerns?">Any Other Real Concerns?</h2><p>One: Receipts becomes much harder to read. If the assets were purchased by the external vendor, and they have a contract with the seller or selling platform that says that the company that purchased the assets gets usage rights, then we were not the ones that purchased them. </p><p>How do we tell if the assets are purchased? That becomes a bit more difficult if we’re recompiling a project. So far as I can see, some information is lost when we do this. File structure might hint towards this, but is by no means a surefire way to find out. </p><p>And is it just cheaper to purchase these assets ourselves, rather than put the effort into <em>appropriating</em> them?<br/>Yea probably. For example. Here’s the house from SAR:<a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/hq-residential-house-48976?aid=1101l4Qtm" rel="nofollow">https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/hq-residential-house-48976?aid=1101l4Qtm</a> and its on sale for like, 20 dollars. </p><h3 id="OnAssetRecovery/ExtractionforExternalVendorProjects-WaitHoldOnHowDidYouFindTheSARHouse?!"><em>Wait Hold On How Did You Find The SAR House?!</em></h3><p>Some artifacts might be left in the project, and might leave us a trail of breadcrumbs to find things. In the case of the SAR Decompile/Recompile I was able to find a reference to a shader called “not_Lonely”. A quick Google search turns out the not_Lonely website, which lists the house and links to the Unity Asset Store. </p><hr/><hr/><p>These are all my thoughts on this for now. In summary, Yes, its possible. But if it is worthwhile or advisable depends on a plethora of factors, some of which we won’t know until we begin trying to recover the assets. </p>
