                    <p><strong>Global Brain</strong> is a concept where the actions of all NPC’s who exist in the world are commanded by a single parent entity. This would simply be responsible for dictating what an NPC’s goal is, and it is up to the NPC brain to figure out how to accomplish it, be it state machine, GOAP, or some other NPC system.</p><p>This parent entity would be able to observe world states in order to create and assign jobs to NPCs, who would then alter the world states by carrying them out (Ex. “New full truck at loading dock, Truck becomes empty after NPCs interact with it”)</p><p>the global brain would hold a list of all the NPCs in the world and be able to monitor what they are doing/call on them to carry out tasks. Tasks should be able to be generated and assigned via custom logic in order to ensure flexibility/expandability in the system.</p><p />
