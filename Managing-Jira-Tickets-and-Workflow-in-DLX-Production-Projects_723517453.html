This usually requires two separate boards, so that ticket status can be monitored effectively for the two different workflows:<br /><br /></p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" data-local-id="ce416ddf-f9d2-4742-afee-a2e2f23f3553" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 206.0px;" /><col style="width: 207.0px;" /><col style="width: 172.0px;" /><col style="width: 175.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Ticket Type</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Shows on Board</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Active &ldquo;Unresolved&rdquo; Statuses</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Inactive &ldquo;Resolved&rdquo; Statuses</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#fff0b3" class="confluenceTd"><p>2D Asset</p><p>3D Asset</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#fff0b3" class="confluenceTd"><p>Art</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#fff0b3" class="confluenceTd"><p>To Do</p><p>Geometry</p><p>Structure</p><p>Texturing</p><p>Polish</p><p>Import</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#fff0b3" class="confluenceTd"><p>Done</p><p>Archived</p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#eae6ff" class="confluenceTd"><p>User Story</p><p>Bug</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#eae6ff" class="confluenceTd"><p>Development</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#eae6ff" class="confluenceTd"><p>To Do</p><p>In Progress</p><p>In Review</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#eae6ff" class="confluenceTd"><p>Dev Complete</p><p>Done</p><p>Archived</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The thing to be really clear about is the handoff from Art to Dev (and sometimes back again, when bugs are reported that require art changes). The trick to keeping things from falling through the cracks is to LINK and COMMUNICATE.  </p><h2 id="ManagingJiraTicketsandWorkflowinDLXProductionProjects-AssetTicketIntegrationProcess">Asset Ticket Integration Process</h2><p><strong><span data-colorid="wys8rtrgut">STEP 1.</span></strong> ARTIST OR DEVELOPER - Create 2D or 3D asset ticket and link it to an appropriate dev ticket where that asset will be implemented in Unity.  The dev ticket is usually a user story such as &ldquo;As a learner, I need to plug the power cable into the wall socket so that I can use the machine&rdquo;.  In this example, there could be several different asset tickets linked to the user story, such as the Power cable, Electrical outlet, Electrical outlet cover plate. </p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p><strong>EVERY 2D or 3D asset ticket must be linked to a User Story ticket</strong> on the development side of the project.  If there is no user story for a particular art asset, one of two things must be true:  Either the asset is not actually needed in the sim (low priority or non-interactive asset) or the user story is missing! Do not begin work on any asset ticket that is missing a User Story link!</p></div></div><p><strong><span data-colorid="p6m555nmnq">STEP 2.</span></strong> ARTIST - Change the status of the 2D or 3D Asset ticket as needed on the Active Sprint art board, as you create the required asset. When the artwork is completed, you must </p><ul><li><p>Upload the asset to SharePoint. </p></li><li><p>Add a screencap and comment in the Asset ticket, along with a direct link to the asset file(s) in SharePoint. </p></li><li><p>Check the linked User Story - if it is in the current dev sprint, make sure you notify the dev team at standup. </p></li><li><p>Change the status of the 2D or 3D Asset ticket to &ldquo;Awaiting Import to Unity&rdquo;</p></li></ul><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Please note: The &ldquo;Awaiting Import&rdquo; status should only be used when an asset is 100% finished. This means that no further work is planned or needed for the ticket. Do not request for assets to be imported to Unity if more work is required, unless the remaining work is actually going to be done in a different ticket.  Do not continue working on any ticket while it is in in the Import column  of the board - if you discover that more work is required, pull the ticket out of &ldquo;Awaiting Import&rdquo; status back to whichever other step of the workflow is appropriate (e.g. Texturing). You can always put it back into the Import column later, when the work is done.</p></div></div><p><strong><span data-colorid="rziwnrrurs">STEP 3.</span></strong> DEVELOPER - Every day at standup, look for any tickets on the Art board that are in the &ldquo;Import&rdquo; column so that the assets can be imported to Unity. Two possible situations:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>The Asset ticket is linked to a User Story that is still in the backlog. Dev is not ready to implement this story yet, but we still need to import the assets now. Create a ticket &ldquo;As a developer, I need to import the _____________ asset (say what it is - doorknob, fire extinguisher, power cable) so that I can implement it in a future sprint&rdquo;.  LINK the import ticket to (all of) the Asset ticket(s) that need to be imported. Check with the artists to make sure you are getting the right Asset tickets.</p></li><li><p>The Asset ticket is linked to a User Story that is in the current sprint. Make sure that the owner of the dev ticket knows the asset(s) are ready, and make sure that the User Story includes importing AND implementing the asset(s) in the sim.</p></li></ol><p><strong><span data-colorid="pcnqjpu5mr">STEP 4.</span></strong> DEVELOPER - As soon as your User Story from Step 3 is merged successfully, it will automatically go to status Dev Complete (through the magic of Bitbucket integration with Jira).  HOWEVER, the Asset ticket(s) that are associated with that story will NOT be updated automatically. You must <strong>manually update the status of all the imported Asset tickets to &ldquo;Done&rdquo;</strong> when they have been successfully imported and merged into dev.</p><ul><li><p>Add a comment in each Asset ticket to reference the merge event in the linked User Story</p></li><li><p>Manually update the status to Done for the Asset tickets only.  Do not update the User Story on the dev board - this is done by the project lead when the build is successful.</p></li></ul><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Remember, it is a RISKY MOVE to manually update the status of any ticket to Done, so BE CAREFUL and make sure you have the correct 2D or 3D Asset ticket(s). Double-check the links, talk to the artists, and get this right! Your name is going all over this in the activity log, so it is worth paying attention and being very sure.</p></div></div><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-warning"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-error confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p><strong>WE NEVER MANUALLY UPDATE THE STATUS OF DEV ISSUES TO &ldquo;DONE&rdquo;</strong>.  If you are tempted to manually move a dev ticket to an <strong>inactive status such as Dev Complete or Done</strong>, please stop and reach out to Stacey, Sean, or David.  NEVER EVER do this, even if you think the status is incorrect and you&rsquo;re trying to correct it. Talk to one of us and we&rsquo;ll fix it together.  This applies to user stories, bugs, or any ticket that requires code changes to complete the ticket.  The only way that these tickets can be moved to status &ldquo;Dev Complete&rdquo; is when they are tagged in a PR and merged successfully (Bitbucket pushes the status change to Jira as part of the Merge event).  For this reason, it should never be necessary to manually change the status of any dev ticket to &ldquo;Dev Complete&rdquo; or &ldquo;Done&rdquo;, because the Merge event will take care of this automatically.<br /><br />It is totally normal and permitted to update any ticket manually between &ldquo;active&rdquo; statuses, either forward or backward through the workflow.  For example, you can change the status of a ticket in any of the following ways, and that&rsquo;s completely fine:<br />To Do &rarr; In Progress<br />In Progress &rarr; Review<br />Geometry &rarr; Structure<br />Texturing &rarr; Polish<br />** OR BACKWARDS when more work is needed **<br />Review &rarr; In Progress (going back to do more work)<br />Dev Complete &rarr; To Do (going back to do more work, but not in this sprint)<br />Import &rarr; Texturing (to fix a texture problem prior to import)</p><p>The only forbidden case is when you move a dev ticket from ANY other status &rarr; Dev Complete or Done. Never do that - only a Jira Admin such as David, Stacey, or Sean can manually change the status of an active production project DLX ticket to Dev Complete or Done.</p><p>At the end of a sprint, when the build is successful and the sprint is completed, the project lead will manually push the status of &ldquo;Dev Complete&rdquo; tickets to &ldquo;Done&rdquo;.  Why is that allowed?  Because the tickets are already in a resolved state of Dev Complete.  They made the jump from active to inactive when they went to Dev Complete (this is an automatic change, not manual).  Updating them to Done when the build is complete is a good way to know when the tickets are included in the most recent demo build.<br /><br />Asset tickets must be manually updated from Import &rarr; Done because they will never get a Merge event trigger from Bitbucket to move them automatically.  Asset tickets are ONLY updated to Done when they are linked to a dev ticket that has been successfully merged (status of the linked dev ticket must be Dev Complete or Done). <strong>NEVER update the status of any Asset ticket to Done if it is not currently in status Import AND shows a linked dev ticket that is merged.</strong></p></div></div><hr />
