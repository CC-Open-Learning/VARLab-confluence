The demo builds are made available to the project stakeholders for them to playtest and provide feedback at the end of every sprint, which reduces the need for a big, formal evaluation at the end of the development phase of the project.  For some projects, we will still execute a formal student evaluation of the DLS prior to General Release, but process updates such as incremental release schedules and Service Updates have drastically reduced the pressure to obtain formal pre-release &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; of the DLS.</p></div></div><p>At the conclusion of each DLS project, prior to submitting the DLS to VARLab Leadership Team for general release, we are required to obtain feedback from real-world users (students and instructors) to validate that our DLS is usable and that it satisfies its learning objectives. This page describes the steps involved to complete that stage of the project.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/247660671/460226621.png" data-image-src="attachments/247660671/460226621.png" data-height="689" data-width="1192" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="460226621" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20211117-231237.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="247660671" data-linked-resource-container-version="11" data-media-id="05f7b9d1-42c6-4528-8996-faf7823b205d" data-media-type="file" /></span><p /><p>Ideally, the UAT Process should begin when the project team estimates that there are less than 5 sprints left in the project.  At that point, you need to request that the content expert(s) provide a list of approximately 10-15 students and instructor volunteers who can participate in testing.</p><p>For externally developed sims, remember to give yourself time to get familiar with the DLS. See <a href="UAT---Externally-developed-DLS_406552577.html" data-linked-resource-id="406552577" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">UAT- Externally Developed DLS page</a> for more details</p><h3 id="UserAcceptanceTesting(UAT)Process-DesigntheUATFeedbackSurvey"><a class="external-link" href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/l/c/d9HF41H1" rel="nofollow">Design the UAT Feedback Survey</a></h3><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">o&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine where the user will be intercepted.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">o   Ask the content experts for particularly important pieces of the simulation.

To be meaningful, the questions need to provide information that can be acted upon.  For every question you compose for users, make sure it is clear what you would need to do to correct the situation, if the response to the question indicated that users were unhappy or dissatisfied with the DLS.  If you ask &ldquo;Did you enjoy this simulation?&rdquo; and the majority of your test volunteers say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, you have nothing to go on.  You can either ask more specific questions, such as &ldquo;Do you feel like this simulation provided you with enough information to prepare for your in-person classes?&rdquo;, or you can ask follow up questions, such as &ldquo;Please describe what information is missing&rdquo; or &ldquo;What changes could we make to provide the right information?&rdquo;.</p><ul><li><p>Create the survey with <a class="external-link" href="https://www.office.com/launch/forms?auth=2" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Forms</a> (I like to copy the survey(s) from a recent project and then update them) and add a Collaboration link in the VARLab&rsquo;s SharePoint folder and/or on the project UAT page.  MS Forms will give you (by default) a link that allows someone to respond to your survey, but that is NOT the link we want.  In the Share menu, scroll down until you get to the &ldquo;Share to Collaborate&rdquo; link - copy THAT link into the SharePoint folder and the UAT page. </p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/247660671/460226610.png" data-image-src="attachments/247660671/460226610.png" data-height="431" data-width="981" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="460226610" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20211117-224550.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="247660671" data-linked-resource-container-version="11" data-media-id="7faebe83-4850-4f92-8de8-2f9c9c08a494" data-media-type="file" /></span></li><li><p><del>Add the method to intercept the users in the simulation.</del></p><ul><li><p><del>This can be a link inside the simulation (which needs to be removed prior to general release)</del></p></li><li><p>This can be a link added to the UAT course shell, that needs to be clicked after the volunteer has completed the simulation.
