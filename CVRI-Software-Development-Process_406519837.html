The broader <a href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAR/pages/315195452/DLS+Project+Process" data-linked-resource-id="315195452" data-linked-resource-version="10" data-linked-resource-type="page">Project Phases</a> page describes a more complete lifecycle view of our DLS projects. This page will focus entirely on the &ldquo;In-Flight&rdquo; phase of a project, breaking that phase down into smaller component pieces.</p><p>The processes represented here are sequential, but there is plenty of overlap from one phase to the next. Each of these processes interacts with others, often in an iterative cycle that is difficult to represent in a diagram.  Even though the sequence is roughly correct and consistent across projects, it isn&rsquo;t really true that we stop doing Step 1 and start doing Step 2.</p><p>Essentially, all of our projects (both research projects and production projects) follow a pretty standard flow:</p><p>&lt;insert diagram here&gt;</p><p>With that process in mind, this page will provide resources and process documentation to help provide guidance through each stage.</p><h2 id="CVRISoftwareDevelopmentProcess-RequirementsGathering">Requirements Gathering</h2><p>Collect documents about requirements here. Include functional requirements, model/asset requirements, interaction requirements, etc.  This process is normally well underway during the Opportunity Selection phase, where we need to establish clear expectations with the project stakeholders with regard to the learning objectives, the role of the DLS in the teaching and learning process, and the deployment plan for the DLS modules.  </p><p>Based mainly on the requirements documented in the project charter, the DLS requirements will be defined in the Confluence DLS project page by the Prinicipal Investigator.</p><h3 id="CVRISoftwareDevelopmentProcess-FunctionalRequirements">Functional Requirements</h3><p>Functional requirements describe the minimally viable requirements that a DLS must satisfy in order to fulfill a project charter.  The definition will always include learning objectives and/or target outcomes, but often also includes requirements to meet the needs of instructors or regulatory concerns.  </p><p>These requirements are often laid out in a table format, which may include direct links to the Jira project for the DLS.  Depending on the project, the functional requirements may be more or less specific. In  most cases, functional requirements will clearly identify WHAT the finished DLS must deliver, without specifying HOW that will be achieved.  This leaves room for technical innovation and encourages team-based design, rather than leaving it up to one person to design the entire DLS.</p><p>Here is an example of a high-level table of Functional Requirements for a pre-flight DLS project about Shop Safety:<br /></p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/406519837/506069014.png" data-image-src="attachments/406519837/506069014.png" data-height="779" data-width="967" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="506069014" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20220804-180640.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="406519837" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" data-media-id="a723f023-2d98-4886-8dfd-8280c526c62b" data-media-type="file" /></span><p /><h3 id="CVRISoftwareDevelopmentProcess-AssetRequirements">Asset Requirements</h3><p>Assets are all of the visual media that are used in the DLS.  Everything from photos, videos, diagrams, and schematics, all the way up to photorealistic 3D models.  We need to document the process of asset development, starting from the decision to buy vs building from scratch, and the rationale behind those decisions.</p><p><strong>Asset Acquisition</strong></p><p>The decision to buy vs build from scratch is a very crucial one that helps us deliver the project on time with minimal efforts or money spent and making optimum utilization of time and resources.</p><p>The idea behind the process of art required for a certain project depends on the requirements of the project. Projects that require 3D assets to be made also have the possibility of the assets being bought from the online store (if available) which can give the Project a head start in getting the base and then the remaining assets can be built around it. We prefer to only look for Lowpoly assets as it is a core requirement for our simulations to run smoothly, we need a strong reason to go for high poly count assets since they will be required to be reduced later.</p><p><u>Questions to ask self:</u></p><p>In making the decision of buying vs making we need to identify a couple of steps by asking ourselves questions:</p><ul><li><p>What is the Price of the Asset that needs to be purchased and if it is cheaper to be made by an Artist?</p></li></ul><p>Mostly the work done by artists takes more resources in terms of time and money if things are built from scratch, it is always advisable to look for pre-existing pieces of work on the online store for purchase and verify if the price to purchase is over the time an artist would take to make it.</p><ul><li><p>What is the quality of the asset we are looking for? </p></li></ul><p>The quality of the asset in terms of our requirement, quality is determined if it matches real-world scale and detail. (Should not be cartoony or disproportionate)</p><ul><li><p>Is the asset low enough does it have most of the pieces and components we need for our sim?</p></li></ul><p>Since our simulations need to be run on multiple platforms we need to identify if the asset is low poly enough and/or can be quickly reduced into a Low Poly. We also need to see if we are getting the optimum from our purchase and so even if we pay a bit more but have some key important components that are required added to the purchase then it is the better choice.</p><ul><li><p>What are the good-to-have features while purchasing a model? What makes us choose one model from the other?</p></li></ul><p>It is a bonus if the assets purchased are also Uv and textured, this helps either utilize the asset without much work on them, or the textures can be transferred with new UVs. So it is always better to purchase a model that already has these details in them.</p><p><u>Alternative thinking:</u></p><p>A lot of the time the assets that we want to purchase will not be available all in one specific model, and during this situation, we need to make a conscious decision to possibly make multiple purchases around a similar model or DLS. This decision is purely based on the advantage that we might have over the purchase of the model since making a model from scratch is expensive most of the time. Reworking on purchased models is sometimes a savior or sometimes it turns out to be more time-consuming. We need to identify this before purchasing a model, we need to know how much extra work will we have to do after the purchase has been made.</p><p>We make our purchase by confirming amongst the team that we are going for it and that it is a rationally thought decision. We put up a purchase request at: </p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/PLZ/board" rel="nofollow">https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/PLZ/board</a></p><p>We need to create a ticket and fill in the details that involve filling out elements like cost of purchase, licensing terms, work needed on the asset after purchase, link to the asset purchase page, etc.</p><p><u>Example:</u></p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-left" width="442" loading="lazy" src="attachments/406519837/506396844.png?width=442" data-image-src="attachments/406519837/506396844.png" data-height="283" data-width="766" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="506396844" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20220805-163155.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="406519837" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" data-media-id="598ba274-5944-4d7f-aa43-5b09a99108fa" data-media-type="file" /></span><p>We need to fill in and submit this ticket to make an asset purchase request which will be reviewed and action will be taken.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>ALL assets in any DLX project must be imported to Unity in order to be implemented in the scene.

The emphasis on getting good user feedback, from students and instructors in the target audience, does not change and is of very high importance for every DLX project!  What is shifting is when we gather this feedback, not whether we gather it.  For comparison, here is a table to show UAT vs Incremental release strategies for integrating user feedback into a final product:</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="h0l20thf4j">UAT strategy timeline: </span></strong>Notice how we get exactly ONE chance to gather feedback and implement it.

In practice, we discovered some drawbacks to this approach: e.g. If we made a simple mistake in the first segment (blue), we might have repeated that mistake in dozens of interactions throughout the user experience, requiring very widespread cleanup by the time the problem is identified. Also, we only get one opportunity to resolve a user problem before final release - if our fix did not satisfy the user complaint, they are stuck with it.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/406519837/729219125.png" data-image-src="attachments/406519837/729219125.png" data-height="73" data-width="998" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="729219125" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20230609-142322.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="406519837" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" data-media-id="c97a94ba-2d28-4fa1-9171-870959115e2a" data-media-type="file" /></span><p><strong><span data-colorid="vw3rao0yea">Incremental release strategy timeline:</span><span data-colorid="fhyzwjsusp"> </span></strong>Notice the iterative nature of this method, which allows us to validate the work that has been done so far, and apply feedback as we go.

Each release INCLUDES and REPLACES the previous version, and each release is 100% complete and user ready: </p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/406519837/729677874.png" data-image-src="attachments/406519837/729677874.png" data-height="286" data-width="534" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="729677874" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20230609-150212.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="406519837" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" data-media-id="4292bba2-2cd4-4c1b-8541-a5d18fb6184f" data-media-type="file" /></span><p /><h2 id="CVRISoftwareDevelopmentProcess-GeneralRelease">General Release</h2><p>I&rsquo;m not sure this is written down anywhere right now - I will check with Sean</p><p>VLT approval is required prior to release.</p><h3 id="CVRISoftwareDevelopmentProcess-Deployment">Deployment</h3><ol start="1"><li><p>Once you have submitted the UAT Summary Report to VLT and obtained approval for general release, you need to <strong>create Model Course Shell in eConestoga</strong>. VARLab staff that are also faculty (e.g. Sean Yo, Jordan Robinson, Michael Yingbull) are all able to do this.  They should use this format to create the model shell: </p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/406519837/447217665.png" data-image-src="attachments/406519837/447217665.png" data-height="214" data-width="507" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="447217665" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20210922-142954.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="406519837" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" data-media-id="bc28f777-9ebc-40e5-9465-8e153185029b" data-media-type="file" /></span><p>Note that it is acceptable (maybe even recommended) to use numbers at the end of the Temporary Code and Shell Title, if you suspect that this course may be one of a series (e.g. VARLAB-CSI-1, VARLab - Crime Scene Investigation - 1)</p></li><li><p><strong>Add the course module(s) to the model course shell</strong>, being EXTREMELY careful to upload the EXACT version of the DLS that was approved for release.  Check the date/time on the SCORM object(s).  Your attention to detail at this step is critical - you need to triple-check that you are deploying the correct version! Once an instructor copies this course, we lose all ability to update/recall that material. </p></li></ol><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>If you are at all unsure about which version of the SCORM package(s) to deploy, do not proceed. Stop and check, get help from other members of the team.</p></div></div><p>Be sure to include all required materials for deployment, such as user documentation, simulation transcript, etc. <strong> Be careful to ensure that all modules are NOT GRADED</strong>. None of our simulations will report a grade to the LMS, so it is essential that grading be turned off (otherwise the grade is recorded as a zero).</p><p>3. <strong>Play through the content once</strong> to ensure that you have deployed the correct material and there was no problem with the upload.</p><p>4. <strong>Enrol the instructor(s)</strong> that will use the DLS for their students. Go to Course Admin &gt; Classlist &gt; Add Participants &gt; Search and enroll users.  Search using Conestoga email address (do not search by name because there can be multiple results with the same name).  <strong>Use the role &ldquo;Copy Access Only&rdquo;</strong> - do NOT enroll instructors using the &ldquo;Instructor&rdquo; role, even though this is their real-life job title.  In eConestoga, the Instructor role has edit/overwrite/delete capabilities, and nobody should be able to edit the model course other than VARLab staff.</p><p>5. <strong>Email the instructor(s) with basic instructions for how to copy the model course</strong> into their own course shell.
