</div><p>This document outlines common considerations that need to be taken while developing assets for the CORE Engine simulations and what information is helpful to communicate with the programming team when your assets are complete.</p><h1 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-Workflow">Workflow</h1><p>The workflow the team should aspire to is the industry standard as outlined here:</p><ol><li><p>High Detail Mesh (Highpoly)</p></li><li><p>Low Detail Mesh (Game Mesh <a href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAR/pages/106004550/Visual+Asset+Technical+Guide#Level-of-Detail" rel="nofollow">LOD0</a>)</p></li><li><p>UV Low Detail Mesh</p></li><li><p>Bake Details from Highpoly to Game Mesh UV</p></li><li><p>Create Texture Maps</p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="fgto3ce6bk">(Optional)</span> Create <a href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAR/pages/106004550/Visual+Asset+Technical+Guide#Level-of-Detail" rel="nofollow">Level of Detail</a> meshes</p></li><li><p>Export Game Mesh and Texture Maps for Unity</p></li><li><p>Change Import Settings in Unity for Mesh/Texture &amp; Create Materials</p></li></ol><p>Not every model will follow this workflow but it should serve as a guide for an ideal asset workflow.</p><h2 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-ModelConsiderations">Model Considerations</h2><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-DetailDensity">Detail Density</h3><p>Areas of your model that will be viewed the most often or with the most scrutiny should have the most geometric detail. If you are absolutely certain that a specific area of your model will never be viewed by an end-user it is beneficial to performance, file space, and UV space if you delete those faces.</p><p>Be careful about this as you may find that your asset is used differently than you expected. A situation may occur where a modification is later required due to an area of a model that was considered out of view becoming a focal point due to a new feature.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-MaterialUsage">Material Usage</h3><p>In an ideal world every single opaque object in a scene would share the same texture maps and material. When it comes to 3D applications, due to <a href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAR/pages/106004550/Visual+Asset+Technical+Guide#Context-Switching" rel="nofollow">Context Switching</a> it is optimal to do as much as you can with a single material.</p><p>While it is not a major consideration for CORE Engine specifically as a desktop application, we can at least try to make sure every distinct mesh has only one material. If an object has a combination of opaque and translucent sections, separating them into two materials is desired.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-VertexDuplication">Vertex Duplication</h3><p>This is a consideration that is not extremely important but a good fundamental concept to understand.</p><p>Wherever your model has multiple values for its <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnatomyofaMesh.html" rel="nofollow">normal vector, UV coordinates, etc</a> at a single position, the vertex at that position is duplicated. This is due to how meshes store this data, every vertex can have one normal vector and one set of UV coordinates.</p><p>The first important duplication is a UV seam. UV seams occur when you have multiple vertices on your UV map that represent the same vertex on your actual mesh. Since this vertex needs to have multiple UV coordinates, the game engine will duplicate that vertex as many times as it needs to in order to store all that information.</p><p>The same occurs with smoothing groups. If you have a sphere where all the faces are set to the same smoothing group and the object is visually smooth, each vertex on that sphere will only have one normal vector. If you then made every face of that sphere have a hard edge, the vertices would become duplicated as now every vertex needs 4 normal vectors to make the sharp edges.</p><p>Due to this, you may find your models show a vertex and triangle count in your modelling program that is way fewer than what the game engine says. An experienced 3D modeller will intentionally make their UV seams occur on seams where the smoothing changes to get more value out of their vertex duplication.</p><h2 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-UVMappingConsiderations">UV Mapping Considerations</h2><p>When it comes to UV mapping your meshes for use in a game engine, there are a few things to keep in mind.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-TexelDensity">Texel Density</h3><p>The amount of space on your UV map that you give any individual area should <em>initially </em>be a perfect representation of its physical size so that the texel density between all the parts of your model is equal.</p><p>If you were to apply a pure checkerboard texture to your model at this stage, every square that appears on your model as a result would be of equal size.</p><p>Once the texel density has been made consistent across your model, it is now time to consider which areas of the model will be viewed by end-users the most often or with the most scrutiny.</p><p>For example in the Motive Power module, the cargo carrier on top of the SUV will likely only ever be viewed from the top down or the side. Due to this it makes sense to use less texture space for the bottom of the cargo carrier relative to those other areas. This allows us to squeeze the most we can out of the limited texture space and make the most important areas of the model more detailed.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-RecycleUVSpace">Recycle UV Space</h3><p>If you have a mesh that shares a lot of duplicate geometry, it can make a big difference to re-use parts of your texture for those identical areas.</p><p>This can also be applied to symmetrical objects where they are mirrored about some axis. When doing so with a model that has baked its Normal Map from a highpoly, bear in mind that one side will have incorrect lighting information as your baked tangent-space normals are now mirrored on that side.</p><p>If you have an object like a long rope, you can get away with creating a small texture that provides enough detail for a few inches of that rope and then scale the UV beyond the boundaries to repeat that texture over and over.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-Padding&amp;TextureBleeding">Padding &amp; Texture Bleeding</h3><p>Leaving space between parts of your UV is important to prevent texture bleeding. Texture bleeding occurs in Unity when you move further from the object you&rsquo;re viewing which reduces the resolution of that texture using a technique called <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap" rel="nofollow">mipmapping</a>.</p><p>As the resolution is reduced, so are the number of pixels that your UV coordinates can be mapped to in the texture. What occurs is that if parts of the UV are too close together, or the texture has no extra padding around your UV areas, portions of the texture image can &ldquo;bleed&rdquo; onto other areas of your model.</p><p>In the most common case the bleed will be whatever color is being used for negative space within your texture. If the texture has black everywhere outside the UV, black edges will begin to bleed onto your model as the viewer gets further and further away.</p><p>To combat this, when performing a texture bake/export, make sure you have enabled padding and applied an appropriate amount of it. For a quick guide on how much padding to use for your textures, <a class="external-link" href="http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/Edge_padding" rel="nofollow">check out this article</a>.</p><h4 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-Example">Example</h4><p>This example shows what padding might look like in a texture map in comparison to the boundary of a section of your UV map.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/106004550/106004770.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/106004550/106004770.jpg" data-height="472" data-width="828" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="106004770" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="padding_example.jpg" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="106004550" data-linked-resource-container-version="25" data-media-id="7cab8162-b522-4d05-ae6c-612dd99efbc0" data-media-type="file" /></span><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-TextureAspectRatios">Texture Aspect Ratios</h3><p>While it is most common to UV and export textures at a 1:1 aspect ratio (512x512, 1024x1024, etc), there is nothing preventing the use of other aspect ratios as long as the numbers are powers of 2. If you find yourself with a UV that could realistically fit in about half the space vertically, shrinking it to fit in a 2x1 space (e.g 2048x1024) benefits both performance and size on disk.</p><h2 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-TexturingConsiderations">Texturing Considerations</h2><p>When creating the texture maps for your models to be used in a CORE Engine module, the current desired set of maps are as follows:</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" data-local-id="c115172d-f4d1-4f1d-beae-4086f71aaa32" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 134.0px;" /><col style="width: 624.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Map</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Notes</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterAlbedoColor.html" rel="nofollow">Albedo</a></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Basic texture for the model.

There can be a lot of pitfalls initially when it comes to getting your assets into Unity.</p><p>Additionally, if you feel that your asset is not being presented within the simulation the way it was intended, be vocal and let the rest of the team know. If the lighting is wrong or the shader values on the material don&rsquo;t match the way you feel it should look, let someone know and explain what the team can do to fix it.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-PhysicsModels">Physics Models</h3><p>For assets that will be effected by physics, the engine needs some way to know what that asset looks like within the physics engine. If the team wishes to use a <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshCollider.html" rel="nofollow">Mesh Collider</a> for your object, you will need to produce a much simpler version of your model that provides the general shape of the object in under 255 triangles.</p><p>If your object will never interact with another <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MeshCollider.html" rel="nofollow">Mesh Collider</a> that limit drastically increases allowing for more detailed physics interactions with other <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.html" rel="nofollow">Colliders</a> like <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/BoxCollider.html" rel="nofollow">boxes</a>, <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SphereCollider.html" rel="nofollow">spheres</a>, and <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CapsuleCollider.html" rel="nofollow">capsules</a>.</p><p>For simple objects it is wasteful to use complex physics shapes so communication is necessary between the development teams to understand if a simple Collider shape will work for the application or if a more specific physics model is required.</p><h4 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-Example.1">Example</h4><p>For the vehicles in the Motive Power disaster scenarios, it was necessary to build custom physics models to allow for proper simulation of lifting each vehicle and dropping them off the hoist.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" alt="Physics Model Example" loading="lazy" src="attachments/106004550/106037558.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/106004550/106037558.jpg" data-height="604" data-width="1114" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="106037558" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="physics_model_example.jpg" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="106004550" data-linked-resource-container-version="25" data-media-id="3f351a55-8f38-41ae-a3d7-a089d425b526" data-media-type="file" /></span><p>Here we can see the original mesh on the left and the corresponding physics mesh on the right. As you can see, this is a very low detail approximation of the vehicle&rsquo;s shape but far better than a simple box would achieve while staying below 255 triangles.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-ImportSettings">Import Settings</h3><p>When someone is importing your assets into Unity, they need to know what settings are relevant for that asset and what settings you might recommend.</p><p>An example would be a mug that is part of the environment. The person importing this asset might not know that a 2048x2048 texture for a mug viewed at a distance is astronomical while only importing your 4096x4096 texture for your centerpiece model at half resolution will make it blurrier than you designed it to be.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-ModelExportSettings">Model Export Settings</h3><p>When it comes to models, the preferred file type to export as is <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-exportFBX.html" rel="nofollow">Autodesk .fbx</a>. This format allows for everything to be imported as a whole including materials, skeletal rigs, animations, etc or in as many individual files as desired. Exporting your animations as one long animation file with all of them one after the other is acceptable in Unity as the importer allows them to be broken up into their individual animations.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-TextureExportSettings">Texture Export Settings</h3><p>For CORE Engine modules, there is a custom shader that combines the <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterMetallic.html" rel="nofollow">metallic</a>, <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterSmoothness.html" rel="nofollow">smoothness</a>, and <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterOcclusionMap.html" rel="nofollow">occlusion</a> maps into a single texture to save on file space and video memory. For this shader, you will need to export your Metallic map as the red channel, Smoothness as the green channel, and Occlusion as the blue channel.</p><p>When exporting textures, if the material does not need an <a class="external-link" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1945/alpha-channel" rel="nofollow">Alpha Channel</a>, try to remember not to export it with one. Alpha channels in Unity double the amount of file space used by that texture. The alpha channel can also be ignored in the texture import settings if you forget.</p><p>For the goal of reducing the file size of the <a class="external-link" href="https://bitbucket.org/VARLab/core-engine/src/development/" rel="nofollow">development repository</a>, it is recommended to export textures as .png files as the <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate" rel="nofollow">Deflate</a> algorithm does a very good job at reducing file sizes without being a lossy compression format.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-NormalMaps">Normal Maps</h3><p>Depending on the program and method used to generate your normal maps, they may or may not be in the correct format for Unity. This can cause issues where lighting does not properly interact with your object causing odd visuals.</p><p>For a deep dive on the potential pitfalls you may encounter while exporting your normal maps into Unity, <a class="external-link" href="https://bgolus.medium.com/generating-perfect-normal-maps-for-unity-f929e673fc57" rel="nofollow">check out this article</a>. </p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-HelpfulLinks">Helpful Links</h3><p><a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html" rel="nofollow">Unity Texture Importing Documentation</a></p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ImportingModelFiles.html" rel="nofollow">Unity Model Importing Documentation</a></p><h1 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-Performance">Performance</h1><p>While the simulations are currently not pushing the boundaries of modern hardware, it is always good practice to follow industry standards for performance or at least be aware of them.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-Triangle/VertexLimits">Triangle/Vertex Limits</h3><p>Every asset to be used in the engine should have a mesh with a triangle/vertex count that makes sense for its size within the viewer&rsquo;s screen. For example if an object takes up 3/4 of the screen it&rsquo;s more reasonable for it to use 100,000 triangles than it is for a pop can in the distance to use 5,000.</p><p>Limits for triangle/vertex counts will always be an estimate, modern hardware can crunch through this with relative ease and there are much more important considerations when it comes to performance.</p><p>As this is not a perfect science, it is better to look at games throughout the years as examples. <a class="external-link" href="http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/Polygon_Count#Typical_Triangle_Counts" rel="nofollow">Here is an informational post from Polycount on the topic.</a></p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-TextureSizeLimits">Texture Size Limits</h3><p>Textures may be submitted as high resolution as you wish, in the end the choice for what resolution to use comes down to the developer who handles the <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html" rel="nofollow">import settings</a> for your texture maps.</p><p>Make sure that whoever is importing your textures understands what resolution should be used. Larger textures require more processing time on the <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" rel="nofollow">graphics processing unit</a> (GPU) as well as additional video RAM.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-LevelofDetail">Level of Detail</h3><p>Game engines such as Unity have built in <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap" rel="nofollow">texture mipmapping</a> by default to reduce the resolution of your texture maps as the object using them moves further from the user&rsquo;s view. This provides a benefit to performance as well as aliasing artifacts however when it comes to models a different system is used called <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LevelOfDetail.html" rel="nofollow">Level of Detail (LOD).</a></p><p>For models that will be viewed at various distances throughout simulations, such as a modular pack of environment assets or a vehicle that drives away from the user, these meshes should be exported with various levels of detail in terms of triangle/vertex count.</p><p>If we have an extremely detailed mesh for a vehicle that is being inspected and later it is placed in the background of another simulation in a parking lot, it is wasteful to have the full detail model get used while the user cannot make out those details.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-FrustrumCulling">Frustrum Culling</h3><p>Cameras in Unity only render objects whose boundaries are present within its <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnderstandingFrustum.html" rel="nofollow">viewing frustrum</a>. If an object is so large that the user cannot actually view it in its entirety at all times, it can save on performance to break the object up into sub-meshes that will stop being rendered while out of view.</p><p>For example if the back seats of a vehicle are a sub-mesh of the whole vehicle they will not be rendered while the user is looking at the dashboard.</p><h3 id="VisualAssetTechnicalGuide-ContextSwitching">Context Switching</h3><p>A context switch is any action that causes the <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit" rel="nofollow">computer&rsquo;s logical processor</a> (CPU) to communicate with its <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" rel="nofollow">graphics processing unit</a> (GPU). This can be an action such as changing the <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html" rel="nofollow">material</a> it needs to use, changing the <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh.html" rel="nofollow">mesh</a> it needs to render, and many other actions.</p><p>Every time a context switch occurs it comes with a cost to performance. Time spent waiting for the other component to send or receive information takes time and that time adds up.</p><p>If a single model uses multiple materials, each of those materials will create a context switch called a SetPass call, slowing down the render thread on the CPU. Draw calls are less of a concern as Unity contains a system to batch models that are using the same material together. This creates an opportunity where you can have an entire environment using one material that only takes one draw call if all of your objects used the same texture maps.</p><p /><p />
