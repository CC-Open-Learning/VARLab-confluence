Since 2024, the ID&rsquo;s have been evolving our instructor supports and resources on a per-project basis, to meet this need in customized and enhanced ways.</p><p>This process is not formally retired, but should be viewed as the bare minimum required for any DLX production project at CVRI.  Many projects get much more instructor support than what is described here - this is old news!</p></div></div><p>It helps a lot for instructors to have a clear idea of what the DLS is like, so that they can make good use of it in their course.</p><p>Instructors often want to know 3 main things:</p><h2 id="InstructorOrientationtoaNewDLX-WhatisthisandhowdoIuseit:"><span data-colorid="qbns5tbm2z">What is this and how do I use it:</span></h2><p>Explain the <strong>main objective</strong> of the DLS, for example, &ldquo;In this digital learning experience, students will have the <span data-colorid="y07wh5s3do">opportunity to practice</span> [a particular skill or procedure], so that they can <span data-colorid="snj89w3bh2">build confidence</span>.&rdquo;  </p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>It is really important to avoid using words like &ldquo;teach learners how to&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;show the correct way to&hellip;&rdquo; because our DLS are NEVER the primary method for teaching new skills or information. DLS are always used to <strong>support in-class learning</strong>, and should not be presented as anything else.  We focus exclusively on giving learners a chance to practice, review, gain confidence, self-assess, etc.</p></div></div><p>Point out at the HIGH level, what will be covered and what won&rsquo;t be covered in this DLS.  I like to structure this as a simple table, like this example from the Trucking Pre-Trip Inspection orientation:</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="760" data-layout="default" data-local-id="9d0468cd-2c8a-47eb-a23e-d8b914a932da" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 404.0px;" /><col style="width: 354.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><th data-highlight-colour="#57d9a3" class="confluenceTh"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INCLUDED</strong></p></th><th data-highlight-colour="#ff8f73" class="confluenceTh"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOT INCLUDED</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Step by step guided inspection process (best practice)</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>When/how frequently to inspect the equipment</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Feedback for every student response</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>What to do if something is damaged or worn</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Options for guided and free-roaming play modes</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Grades or performance evaluation, feedback is in-game only.

They will find the DLS content in the Content menu in your course.</p></li><li><p><strong>There is nothing to download or install.</strong>  They play in their web browser.</p></li><li><p>No special equipment is required.  They can use any relatively modern laptop or computer that can login to eConestoga.  <strong>Touchscreen devices such as phones or iPads are not supported. </strong>If the DLS requires the use of headphones or speakers (actually requires it to succeed, not just as a bonus) I say so. Otherwise, I make sure they know that listening to the DLS is optional.</p></li><li><p>Students need internet service to access eConestoga and play the DLS.  It cannot be used &ldquo;offline&rdquo; or without internet.  Low-functioning or intermittent internet service can result in long load times, choppy or lagging visual or audio experience, failure to save progress, or being logged out of eConestoga.</p></li><li><p>Students with IEPs, students living with a disability or impairment, or students with low English literacy may require accommodations to be successful. Instructors are encouraged to work with each student to ensure their needs are met. This is a good point to describe any adaptive materials that are available, such as voiceover transcripts, described video, keyboard shortcuts, etc.</p></li><li><p>The DLS does not report any performance evaluation or results to eConestoga. These modules are <strong>not graded</strong>, and the students do not have any opportunity to &ldquo;hand in&rdquo; or share their DLS results with instructors. Remember that the primary objective of these modules is to support in-class learning by providing the opportunity to practice and gain confidence in a virtual learning environment.</p></li></ul><h2 id="InstructorOrientationtoaNewDLX-HowDoIAddtheDLStoMyOwnCourseShell:"><span data-colorid="xw7lsds113">How Do I Add the DLS to My Own Course Shell:</span></h2><p><strong>eConestoga Training</strong> for remote content delivery and online teaching is provided as part of your instructor training courses.

I don&rsquo;t even try to cover the entire thing, but I make sure that the key points are all covered.</p><p>The best way to do this is to arrange in advance for one of your CE&rsquo;s (or any willing victim) to share their screen while THEY play the DLS (not you).  This is an amazing opportunity to watch other people play, and observe if they do anything unexpected or have any problems that your team might want to know about. I find it is almost impossible for me to go as slowly through the sim as a newbie, so this controls our pace very nicely.  Make sure you cover each of the following aspects during the DLS demo:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Tutorial - if it exists, make sure they know exactly where it is.  I don&rsquo;t actually do the tutorial or intro video for any of the DLS in this demo, but it is always the first thing I show in the toolbar or menu.</p></li><li><p>Prompts - how does the student know what to do next</p></li><li><p>Feedback - how does the student know if they are doing it correctly or not. When does feedback happen and what does it look like?</p></li><li><p>Progress - Identify anything that can stop a learner from being able to move forward. If there are any known &lsquo;sticky&rsquo; areas of the sim where students might get stuck or run into problems, identify them in the demo and make sure that the instructors know how the student should get out of that situation.</p></li><li><p>Known bugs - Let&rsquo;s not pretend this thing is perfect.  We do NOT need to review a laundry list of lowest priority bugs, but I do expect us to shine a light on anything we know could possibly go wrong that would affect a learner&rsquo;s ability to successfully complete the sim.  For example, if a bug has been recorded but cannot be reproduced, we should tell instructors that students might have that problem.  When we make compromises in the design because of something that was extra tricky (e.g. inspecting the license plate lights on the truck during daylight, where the bulb is not visible to the learner), now is a great time to explain that tricky spot and make sure they understand what it looks like or how it works.</p></li><li><p>Multiple play modes - Trucking Release IV is our first DLS that will be released with two different play modes.  It is important to explain the key differences between the two modes, and how each one of them can benefit the students.</p></li><li><p>Hidden options - If there are any extended learning modes or content that is not available to the student when they first launch the DLS (e.g. alternate trailers extended content that becomes available only after the student has completed one of the main inspection play modes), make sure that instructors know about this content up front.  Explain why some options are hidden at first, and be clear about exactly when the content becomes available to the player.</p></li></ol>
