                    <p>One essential element of any product management effort is the validation that we have a shared, ideal vision of the solution with the client or stakeholder. While every product has unique dimensions, the central premise for Discovery is that there are repeatable processes we can depend on to embrace the unique outcomes while planning to leverage our growing capabilities and workshop full of Delivery techniques.</p><p>Discovery processes may rely very heavily on our LEAD team, but we can explore these components to confirm where we rely on strong collaboration with digital artists, software developers, systems engineers, and product managers (aka Principal Investigators).</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="760" data-layout="default" data-local-id="04144982-f13d-4398-904d-8e612d854414" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 226.67px;"/><col style="width: 226.67px;"/><col style="width: 226.67px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th data-highlight-colour="#4c9aff" colspan="3" class="confluenceTh"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Discovery</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Identify Value</strong></p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Brainstorm</strong></p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Validate</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Learning Discovery</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Lean UX Canvas</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Prototyping</p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Selection Matrix</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Design Sprint</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Design Sprint</p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Buy Build Partner</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Solution Document</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Wizard of Oz</p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">MoSCoW</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Concierge</p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Product Vision Charter</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td data-highlight-colour="#deebff" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">Flythrough</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;">||</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td data-highlight-colour="#ffc400" class="confluenceTd"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Earliest Testable Product</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="DiscoveryProcesses-DiscoveryPhases">Discovery Phases</h2><p>Generally speaking, we move a product’s design through these three process groups from left to right (e.g. why prototype if we’ve not done some amount of Learning Discovery?). Below, we’ll discuss each process group in a bit of detail and outline how we may already be doing some of this work.</p><h3 id="DiscoveryProcesses-IdentifyValue">Identify Value</h3><p>The essential start of the product discovery journey. The DLX team has long practiced many of these processes, even if some are done on an as-needed basis (such as Buy-Build-Partner). Several meetings with potential stakeholders may occur that contribute to uncovering the pain points in curriculum delivery that a DLX product may help address. Work to evaluate an area of need through our Selection Matrix and Buy-Build-Partner analysis consistently helps us be both well-targeted and pragmatic in proposing the shape of any potential solution. The usual output of this process is a Product Vision Charter which summarizes the key problems, solutions, and desired outcomes that will be agreed upon by senior stakeholders and will unlock further investment of work to build the DLX product.</p><p>The concept of MoSCoW might be new to some members of our team - at least in terms of the acronym. It is a process by which we document and consider product features along a ‘Must have’, Should have', Could have', and ‘Would be nice if…’ level of prioritization. It is a common sense practice that enters a lot of our thinking, but this Playbook seeks to elevate this to a regularly occurring investment of clarity and organization of early product thinking.</p><h3 id="DiscoveryProcesses-Brainstorm">Brainstorm</h3><p>To think of this phase with a classic image in our minds of endless post-it notes dominating massive whiteboards is a warm and familiar exercise. Entering 2024 with a product management focus enables to invest even more helpful and comprehensive processes, however. Facilitated sessions with our stakeholders to evolve our understanding of the desired product from the User eXperience lense are critical to execute as is the development of Solution Documentation that is a more comprehensive evolution of the Product Vision Charter. To enable strong team collaboration in this phase, we invest time and staffing into a Design Sprint to coordinate and deliver on this important level of collaboration with our Content Experts and our team.</p><h3 id="DiscoveryProcesses-Validate">Validate</h3><p>There will always be more than one approach to solve a design challenge. Ultimately, we need to be able to describe our understanding of the stakeholder’s position on the learning challenges our DLX product can resolve. We can deploy evaluative approaches (Wizard of Oz) where we test a solution hypothesis, or we can take a generative approach (Concierge) to somewhat roleplaying through a confirmation that our solution could meet the needs of the learner. Further investment of time and staffing into a Design Sprint allows us to leverage existing art and code to express rapid prototypes that might allow a Flythrough experience to be demonstrated to the stakeholders for even more validation. </p><h3 id="DiscoveryProcesses-EarliestTestableProduct">Earliest Testable Product</h3><p>It might be early and ugly, but the ‘ETP’ represents our ability to give the stakeholders, usually our Content Expert/CE, their first step into the world of the product. When we provide this, we’re able to start realizing an important shift in the CE’s view on the product. They can tend to shift their mindset from outside-in to inside-out design. This would tend to generate an exceptionally valuable sense of ownership or guardianship among the CE’s which heightens their engagement and helps drive success through Delivery.</p>
