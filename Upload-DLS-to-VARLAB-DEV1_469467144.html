Ask a non-coop team member to take over this process at Step 3.  If you aren&rsquo;t sure who to ask, start with Stacey or Jordan.</p></div></div><ol><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="kh0i7aazqo">Build and Name</span></strong>: Start by building or exporting your DLS to a SCORM package.  You can name the package whatever you want, but the filename must include the DATE.  The SCORM package is a zip file - if it doesn&rsquo;t have a nice name on export, just rename it in your local drive before uploading.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="rn25enhhwf">Archive to SharePoint</span></strong>: Upload your SCORM package to the appropriate folder in your SharePoint project workspace.  If this is the first SCORM build for this project, simply create a folder called SCORM. This is an important step because SCORM packages are not stored in our code repositories, and cannot be downloaded from the LMS (eConestoga). SharePoint is our SCORM repo.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="x6ffp5k9tc">eConestoga VARLAB-DEV1</span></strong>:  Navigate to the <a class="external-link" href="https://conestoga.desire2learn.com/d2l/home/418015" rel="nofollow">VARLAB-DEV1</a> course on eConestoga.  You must login with your staff account to access this course.  Click on <strong>Content </strong>in the upper left corner, then browse the Table of Contents to find your DLS project folder.  If a folder does not exist (look carefully, it probably does) you will need to create it by clicking on &lsquo;Add a module&rsquo; at the bottom of the list.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="kw2wvvqn8u">Upload/Create</span></strong>:  From inside your DLS project folder, click on the <strong>Upload/Create</strong> button and then select <strong>New SCORM/xAPI Object</strong> from the dropdown list.  This will open the Add Course Package - SCORM/xAPI dialogue.  Click on &lsquo;<strong>Bulk upload</strong>&rsquo; in the upper right corner of this dialogue and then select your newly built SCORM package from your local drive. This takes awhile, there is a progress bar to let you know how it&rsquo;s going.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="fqrrhc7kw3">Configure Course Package Properties</span></strong>: You can edit the title of your SCORM package here, provided you keep the date as part of the title.  Everyone prefers a different date format, it seems, so just make sure it is clear (ie. don&rsquo;t give me 04-05-22 so that I can&rsquo;t tell if this build was from Apr or May! Try 04MAY2022 or anything that removes ambiguity).  Keep the default settings for &lsquo;Use embedded player&rsquo; and &lsquo;Use built-in navigation&rsquo;.  Click &lsquo;Next&rsquo; to be returned to the Add Course Package - SCORM/xAPI dialogue.  Note: The UI is weird and might be cut off so that you cannot see the buttons at the bottom.  Grab and drag the dialog around on your screen to access the Next button, if it isn&rsquo;t visible.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="a9k70f209j">Adding Course Package</span></strong>: Your newly uploaded SCORM package will now appear in the list. Select it and click Next to open the &lsquo;Adding Course Package&rsquo; dialogue.  In this box, you must change the default value for &lsquo;Do you want a grade item created for this instance?&rsquo; to be NO. Keep the default values for Version Control (always display latest version) and Course Package Player Options (Use embedded player). Click &lsquo;Add&rsquo;.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="oa0w9bepkz">Verify the New Package and Hide the Old Package</span></strong>: When your new SCORM build is successfully added to the module, click on it to launch it (this may occur automatically).  This is a great time to check and make sure that you built what you intended to build (e.g. didn&rsquo;t accidentally include all CORE projects, build was successful, etc).  You don&rsquo;t have to play the whole thing right now, but you do need to verify that your build is successful and contains the sim that you wanted to publish.  Once you have launched and verified your new build, you should hide the previous build to avoid any confusion during playtesting.  Click on the down arrow beside the title of your previous build title and select &lsquo;Hide from Users&rsquo; in the dropdown.  Grab a link to your new package, you&rsquo;ll need it for your demo!</p></li></ol>
