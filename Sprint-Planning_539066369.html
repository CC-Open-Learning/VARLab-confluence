The primary goals of Sprint Planning are:</p><h2 id="SprintPlanning-DecideWhattoDemo(Yes,dothisfirst)">Decide What to Demo (Yes, do this first)</h2><ul><li><p>At the end of each sprint, the project team will deliver a fully deployable build (whatever that looks like for your project, in many cases this will be a SCORM package in the VARLAB-DEV1 space on eConestoga) for internal and stakeholder demos.</p><ul><li><p>INTERNAL demo - Audience is CVRI staff and directors. Show your progress, but don&rsquo;t forget to talk about interesting challenges you faced or problems you solved (lessons learned) in the process.</p></li><li><p>STAKEHOLDER demo - Audience is project stakeholders such as faculty, content experts, industry partners, etc.  This demo is not presented so much as it is PLAYED by the stakeholders, with minimal preamble or explanation from us.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The best way to choose what you need to work on is to <strong>START by deciding what you want to demo</strong>. This decision should be driven by your <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/VARLab/EYuvhtZEbIhLpBK_s19BDpABMExpnsfMwNaF86IBv_G6xA?e=h4inFF" rel="nofollow">Term Plan</a>, which is aligned with your larger project timeline.  The project timeline works backwards from the GR Target date, allowing 2-3 sprints of GR Testing, bug fixing,  and pre-release documentation. Your Term Plan will let you know where your product needs to be by the end of each sprint - that&rsquo;s what you will need to demo.  Once you&rsquo;ve identified that goal as a team, comb through your project backlog to find stories or epics that need to be done to reach that objective.</p></li><li><p>You might have to work back and forth a few times, adjust the demo goal to make it more or less ambitious as you begin to realize how much work it will take to get there from here.</p></li></ul><h2 id="SprintPlanning-BuildtheSprintbyAddingTickets">Build the Sprint by Adding Tickets</h2><ul><li><p>Look each ticket that is proposed for your sprint together as a group. </p><ul><li><p>Is the scope of the ticket clear? Can you all easily identify where this work begins and ends? </p></li><li><p>As a team, do you agree that this ticket represents approx 1 day of work for 1 dev? If not, the ticket might need to be split into 2 or 3 tickets - do this as a team. </p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Do NOT assign tickets to any specific developer</strong> as you go, but consider what is needed to complete the work described in the story.  Do you need media? Utilities? Expertise? Equipment? Information? Can you get what you need in time to include this ticket in this sprint?</p></li><li><p>Consider your demo goal. Is there anything that you need to achieve your demo that ISN&rsquo;T currently reflected in your backlog?  Review the backlog and check for any gaps, and create stories that are missing.</p></li><li><p>Consider the priority of the work - is there anything that needs to be done before something else? Tickets can be linked and notes added to help explain the relative priority of the work.</p></li></ul><h2 id="SprintPlanning-RealityCheck-Isthisenoughwork?Toomuch?">Reality Check - Is this enough work? Too much?</h2><ul><li><p>When you think you&rsquo;ve got enough work, and it fits with your demo goals, there&rsquo;s an easy way to check:</p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="chckdoysk2">Step 1 - Subtractions</span>. Every person on the team needs to tell the team about any planned time away from the office.  You are NOT required to give reasons or justify your time off (of course, it has to be approved by your manager), but you do need to let your team know if you will be away.  Anything more than about 2h absence should be considered as a half-day and should be part of your sprint plan.</p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="ng313rrp4m">Step 2 - Resource Tally</span>. Count up the number of people on the project team.  Respect any meaningful boundaries for the types of work people do (e.g. do a separate headcount for artists vs devs).  Count up the number of working days in this sprint, remembering to subtract the first Monday (Sprint Planning) and the last Friday (Demo Day + Retro) at the very least.  Depending on how many devs are collaborating on your project, you might need to freeze sooner rather than later to allow for all the PR&rsquo;s to be merged and the build to happen before close of business on the Thursday before demo.  This will usually leave about 7 days or so, then you need to apply your subtractions from Step 1.</p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="qdlsi6x407">Step 3 - Do the Scope Math</span>. Since each ticket is about 1 day for 1 dev, and you know how many working days are in your sprint, just multiply it out and check the result against your scope.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/539066369/539852842.png" data-image-src="attachments/539066369/539852842.png" data-height="185" data-width="710" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="539852842" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20221026-201116.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="539066369" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" data-media-id="af897c98-ff8a-4381-a283-da1ebc774c5b" data-media-type="file" /></span></li></ul><h2 id="SprintPlanning-ShareyourSprintPlan">Share your Sprint Plan </h2><ul><li><p>After your team has finalized the sprint plan for your project, your project lead(s) will attend a meeting on Monday afternoon with all of the other DLS project leads.  The goal of this meeting is to make sure that all the teams know what each other is working on during the coming sprint, so that we can identify any conflicts (e.g. two teams need the same resource or equipment at the same time) or opportunities to collaborate (e.g. two teams are both implementing voiceover or embedded video, and they can work together)</p></li></ul>
