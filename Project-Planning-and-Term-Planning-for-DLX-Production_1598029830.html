                    <p>Each project scope and timeline is unique, so this page will try to generalize the process steps required to plan the development effort for DLX projects.  This activity is not usually a team-level planning session, but rather a responsibility of the PI, LEAD, and DNA full-time staffers that will guide the project throughout its production lifecycle.  Sprint Planning is done at the team level and relies on the close involvement of all team members, while Project and Term planning is more of an administrative function that helps us liaise effectively with our executive stakeholders at the departmental level.</p><h3 id="ProjectPlanningandTermPlanningforDLXProduction-TypicalDLXProjectScopeandTimeline">Typical DLX Project Scope and Timeline</h3><p>It isn’t possible to address every project individually, but we can speak in broad terms about “typical” DLX projects at CVRI.  Here are some general points to consider:</p><ul><li><p>Most DLX production projects are expected to take approx 12 months from kickoff to GR</p></li><li><p>12 months = 3 terms</p></li><li><p>3 terms = approx 21 sprints</p></li><li><p>Each sprint is usually 2 weeks long, or 8 production days + Sprint Planning and Demo days.</p></li><li><p>DLX projects are defined at the charter level, which describes the overall learning objectives and program/college level objectives for the project.  It is very rare for a project charter to specify exactly HOW the objectives will be reached - that’s up to CVRI to figure out.  We need to be careful to design a project that has the right scope, focus, usability, accessibility, quality, instructional minutes, and platform requirements to succeed in its intended use cases.  Let’s assume that has happened, and you’re at the stage where you’re ready to start implementation of this awesome plan.</p></li></ul><h1 id="ProjectPlanningandTermPlanningforDLXProduction-ProjectPlanningStep1:MapoftheWorld">Project Planning Step 1:  Map of the World</h1><p>Sit down with your project scope and start dividing your requirements up into functional areas, paying special attention to any dependencies between these functional areas.  Here are some examples of functional areas that have been used in multiple DLX projects, you will have to define your own:</p><ul><li><p><strong>User Workflow by POI </strong>- These are workflows that are location/equipment centric, where we consider all tasks that occur in a particular place or POI. Examples might include Cab Interior, Bench Grinder, Pantry, Battery Test.</p></li><li><p><strong>User Workflow by Procedure</strong> - These are workflows that break down nicely into different segments. It’s okay if the segments all happen in the same physical space or with the same equipment, but the specific tasks and success criteria would depend on the stage of the workflow or the scenario.  Examples might include Setup, Orientation, Lab 3, and minigames.</p></li><li><p><strong>Features </strong>- These are distinct packages or functional areas related to a specific feature, examples would be Tutorial, Save &amp; Load, Progress Indicator, Results.</p></li></ul><p>You can divide the work up however you want, and it’s okay to use multiple different ways of organizing work in a large project.  The goal is to just have a sense of what work is needed, and understand how different high-level functional areas are related to (or dependent upon) one another.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Notice that these are NOT individual requirements at this stage. This is a 30,000ft view of the project - do not get drawn down into the weeds.  Think in chapters, not pages.</p></div></div><h1 id="ProjectPlanningandTermPlanningforDLXProduction-ProjectPlanningStep2:BreakItDownbyTerm">Project Planning Step 2: Break It Down by Term</h1><p>This is where we start putting the functional areas into terms, based on what we know about dependencies and risk. Generally speaking, features or functional areas that have the highest number of dependencies should be implemented as early as possible.  We do not develop the DLX in the order that it will be played.  It’s perfectly okay to start with the final step of the procedure instead of the first step!  All of the requirements will be met before GR, so you can start anywhere and work in any direction that makes sense for your specific project.</p><p><strong>Term 1:  Foundation and Systems,</strong> focus on ENABLING the DLX workflows. This includes elements such as task and feedback management, plus results. The first few playable workflows will guide and validate the systems and foundational work, but the main goal for Term 1 is getting a solid, reliable framework in place that will support all steps of the student workflow. UI/UX is a big focus, we are looking for stable, repeatable interactions.  You should aim to have at least 20% of your total project scope completed at the end of Term 1, even if this is a lower percentage of your playable workflows.  Foundational work often is difficult to demo, so it might feel like progress is slow during Term 1, but lots of essential work is happening!</p><p><strong>Term 2: Workflow Implementation</strong>, focus is on implementing as many steps of the required workflow as possible.  This term can feel like a grind, but it can also feel like you’re flying through a big stack of user stories every week.  When you’ve got really solid, reliable foundations (including UI documents, prefabs, whatever you need) this term will be a huge surge forward.  By the end of Term 2, you should have less than 25% of project scope remaining and most/all of your playable workflow should be completed.</p><p><strong>Term 3:  Wrap It Up and Validate,</strong> focus is on completing any remaining workflows so that we can turn our attention to project-level usability testing and validation.  Now is the time to bring it all together, including features like Save &amp; Load and Analytics, which often are not as testable at earlier stages of the project.  Remember that you need to save the last 2-3 sprints of your project for GR Testing and documentation activities, so you want to make sure that you are Feature Complete (last user stories are implemented and closed) at least 2-3 sprints before your GR target date.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>This is just a general example of Project Planning - it would not be suitable for every project.  I need you to use your imagination to adapt this general concept to projects that are longer, shorter, or have significantly different purpose (e.g. no workflows, like in SCM).  I am using workflows as a way of describing the interactions that are required for the DLX to meet its learning objectives.  Those can look very different in different projects - we are driven by pedagogy, not software processes.  Do your best to translate this concept for your unique project scope and purpose.</p></div></div><p><a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/VARLab/EYuvhtZEbIhLpBK_s19BDpABMExpnsfMwNaF86IBv_G6xA?e=hPZmeb" rel="nofollow">Here is a link to a sample Term Plan template.</a></p><p>At this stage, you need to get more detailed by breaking down your Term goals into smaller sprint goals.  We are STILL not looking at individual requirements or user stories/tickets!  Those don’t really come into it until we go to Sprint Planning.  For now, you just want to make sure that you know how you’re going to get from Point A (beginning of Term) to Point B (end of Term) and check how realistic that goal really is.  </p><p>You might find that you are starting the Term further ahead or further behind than you thought you would be at this stage, or you might be realizing that your team size or velocity is significantly different than expected.  If you find yourself planning a term that just doesn’t sound realistic, you need to call that out so that the leadership team is aware.  You are NOT expected to somehow power through a situation where there is more work than resources or time!  But we do need you to make a plan, and faithfully report how it’s going.  </p><p><strong>It is 100% NORMAL to be off track at various points during the project.  Seriously. </strong> Nothing ever goes exactly as planned!  You will NOT be in trouble, and it is NOT a “problem” when a DLX project is behind where it was expected to be, as long as you communicate what’s going on and participate in efforts to bring the project back on track.  CVRI leadership needs to be informed, and they will sometimes make changes to resourcing or delivery dates as needed, to make sure that the project can cross the finish line with the quality and value that we want all of our products to deliver.</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="760" data-layout="default" data-local-id="5e0eb061-f887-4fba-bc9d-e46e153546d5" class="confluenceTable"><tbody><tr><th data-highlight-colour="#e3fcef" class="confluenceTh"><p>We need to plan so that we know what needs to be done to get to GR.</p></th></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#abf5d1" class="confluenceTd"><p>We need to plan so that we can tell if we are on, ahead, or behind schedule with our work.</p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#57d9a3" class="confluenceTd"><p>The Project Plan drives the Term Plans, which drive the Sprint Plans.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p /><p /><p />
