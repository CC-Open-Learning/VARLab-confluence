                    <p>Some possible variables that could influence NPC behavior. NPC’s could have this value set which would determine how they behave in the world.</p><p /><ul><li><p>Motivation</p><ul><li><p>Could also be described as professionalism or maturity</p></li><li><p>Would impact how diligently they carry out their tasks, likelihood of getting distracted or distracting others, or the time it takes to transition from one task to another</p></li><li><p>Motivation could be influenced by world factors. Being watched closely by a manager/overseer type of entity could increase motivation temporarily</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Skill</p><ul><li><p>Impacts how effective the NPC is at carrying out their tasks.</p><ul><li><p>Higher skill NPCs may be able to complete an action faster</p></li><li><p>Low skill NPCs could make mistakes requiring tasks to be redone</p></li><li><p>Low skill NPCs could be more likely to become frustrated from a task, especially if making mistakes</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Talking implementation for a minute, skill could be represented on a task as a “skill required” value. An NPC with less than the required skill would have a chance to fail the task, increasing frustration (explained in temperature point). NPC teams would benefit from a combined skill level, allowing them to overcome difficult tasks.</p><ul><li><p>If an NPC encounters a task with too high of a skill requirement, it could be given a decision to get help vs attempt it themselves.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Skill could be influenced by working as a team</p><ul><li><p>This opens the door to multi-person tasks for NPC’s. “Lift that heavy box” could be a 2 person task, and it would open up the door for interesting interactions/cases like an NPC going to get help with their task from another NPC.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Temperature/mood/frustration</p><ul><li><p>Value that could drive how they interact with others and the world</p></li><li><p>value could be influenced by events in the world, as well as having a baseline set</p><ul><li><p>Things like having their current task interrupted could raise frustration values</p></li><li><p>If someone repeatedly bumps into them/gets too close while they are trying to work, they may get more frustrated over time as the interruptions persist</p></li></ul></li><li><p>frustrated NPC’s could be prone to making more mistakes due to clouded judgement or rushing</p></li><li><p>Extremely frustrated NPCs may abandon their tasks in order to cool down</p></li><li><p>Dialog could be influenced by NPC frustration. Frustrated NPC’s may have more aggressive dialog options when interacting with players/other NPCs</p></li><li><p>Overcoming a challenging (high skill requirement, see skill section) could provide a temporary mood boost. This could create opportunities for cases like a well managed warehouse resulting in high morale due to successful execution of difficult tasks.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p />
